Welcome! This Word Scramble Game was inspired by the Change++ developer applicant challenge. Change++ is a student organization at Vanderbilt that strives to provide nonprofits with the technical resources and software capabilities to help the community they serve in innovative ways. In my application, you'll have 30 seconds to unscramble as many words as you can. Have fun!

## Reflection
I found this project very fun. I chose to add additional components to the project, such as the 30-second timer, reset button, and sound effects. I found using React and Node js very challenging, but leveraging documentation and online tutorials helped me get on track.
